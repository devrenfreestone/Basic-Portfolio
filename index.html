			<p class="about_text">
				I was born and raised in Mesa, Az. I love the desert, but I especially love the mountains in northern Arizona. Growing up, my family frequently visited the mountains, and to this day it's one of my favorite getaways.

			<p class="about_text">
				I have been married to my best friend, Bri, since September of 2013. We've been on all kinds of adventures together, and she's been a loving and supporting companion through it all. We do our best to make each other happy, and that's been a key for our friendship.
			</p>

			<p class="about_text">
				I studied music education for a few years; I always wanted to teach choir. While that didn't work out, music and choir especially have remained important parts of my life. We look forward to starting to have kids soon and to the challenges life brings.
